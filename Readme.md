# Hireling Framework
[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/tag/BG3-Community-Library-Team/HirelingFramework?label=Latest%20Version)](https://GitHub.com/BG3-Community-Library-Team/HirelingFramework/releases/) [![GitHub commits](https://img.shields.io/github/commits-since/BG3-Community-Library-Team/HirelingFramework/1.0.0/main)](https://GitHub.com/BG3-Community-Library-Team/HirelingFramework/commit/)

Framework to enable Custom Race and Class Hirelings to be manipulated in the way that vanilla hirelings can.

## Installation
This mod works with [Baldur's Gate 3 Mod Manager](https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager), and possibly Vortex and Manual
Installations. BG3 Mod Managers is by far the simplest method, and as such is recommended one.
